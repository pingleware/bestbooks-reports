# BestBooks Accounting Application Framework - Reports
There are no free options for creating reports from content received from a database. jsreports, jasperreports have limited free options.

Hence the report design will go back to basics,

    1. creating an XML document for the data required for the report
    2. display the XML using XSLT with CSS which can be printed or save as a PDF or DOCX (see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/displaying-xml-using-xslt/)
